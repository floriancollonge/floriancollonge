- ðŸ‘‹ Hi everyone, Iâ€™m @floriancollonge, freelance developer, working in software development since 2011
- ðŸ‘€ I like to work on problems, complexe algorithms, or any development while chewing on a bamboo leaf. I'm always talking, asking questions and caring for my teams, which led me to leading teams in quite big projects. Communication is a must for me
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Vue.js and C#, with a bit of software architectures and especially microservices architecture. More generally, I'm always looking on better way to do my work, better way to organize a project, new technologies, etc. We have the chance to work on an always moving, always improving field, so let's challenge ourselves, and try to satiate a bottomless curiosity. Below this section, you will see some of the technologies used in my past projects
